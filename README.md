Co‑Founder, Tent City Studios • Software & Game Developer

### Summary

I architect and refine narrowly scoped, high‑leverage software artifacts—principally Unity (C#) tooling and exploratory indie game prototypes—supplemented by low‑level investigations in C, C++, and Zig to deepen my understanding of systems performance and memory behavior. My practice emphasizes emergent architecture, mechanical sympathy, and the systematic removal of friction points that impede iteration within compact, multidisciplinary teams.

### Focus Areas

* **Game / Engine Tooling:** Design and implementation of editor extensions, deterministic utilities, and instrumentation layers that compress feedback loops for designers and technical artists.
* **Lightweight Service Surfaces:** Minimal operational Discord and community‑facing micro‑features integrating telemetry, moderation heuristics, and automation workflows.
* **Codebase Hygienics:** Progressive hardening of structure and semantics—favoring explicitness, bounded complexity, and traceability over brittle cleverness.

### Selected Contributions

* **Unity Utilities:** Cohesive suite of extension primitives (lifecycle helpers, allocation‑aware collections, editor augmenters) enabling more declarative gameplay scripts and reduced boilerplate.
* **Physics Dropper (Editor Tool):** Edit‑time gravitational placement system accelerating scene composition while preserving deterministic reproducibility across machines.
* **HoboBot (Discord Automation):** Modular bot architecture encapsulating role orchestration, content gating, and scheduled operational tasks for internal studio flows.
* **2006Scape Fork (Legacy Analysis):** Reverse‑engineering oriented traversal of a large historical Java MMORPG server to internalize networking, entity synchronization, and content scripting patterns.

### Technical Competencies

**Primary Stack:** C#, Unity (Editor & Runtime APIs, asset pipeline customization).
**Supplementary / Exploratory:** C, C++, Zig, Python (tool scripts), Bash, Git, Linux tooling, build & packaging workflows.

### Engineering Principles

* **Iterative Minimalism:** Deliver the smallest coherent increment; postpone ornamental abstraction until empirical usage patterns emerge.
* **Mechanical Sympathy:** Align data layouts and update rhythms with engine and hardware characteristics to mitigate contention and GC pressure.
* **Dependency Skepticism:** Prefer lean internal solutions over opaque third‑party layers, retaining auditability and upgrade agility.
* **Readable Precision:** Optimize for immediacy of comprehension by the *next* contributor; document invariants and implicit contracts at integration boundaries.
* **Automation Early:** Externalize repetitive editor / deployment tasks into scripts or menu actions before cognitive drag normalizes.

### Collaboration & Engagement

I welcome dialog on well‑scoped, technically substantive challenges: gameplay systems architecture, deterministic simulation instrumentation, editor tooling, build / deployment streamlining, or refactoring strategies for legacy subsystems. Proposals with clear constraints, measurable outcomes, and a bias toward maintainability are prioritized.
